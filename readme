- feat: seccomp
  description: seccomp is a Linux kernel feature that allows a process to make a one-way transition into a
               "secure" state where it cannot make any system calls except exit(), sigreturn(), and read()
               and write() to already-open file descriptors. This is useful for sandboxing untrusted applications.
